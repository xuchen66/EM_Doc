			of digital camera. The purpose, in most cases, is to have no beam on camera
			except exposure period. Not all camera reaquires having TEM shutter control to
			get an image. For cryoEM applications where accurate dose is to be concerned,
			it makes a lot of sense to have shutter control. Fortunitely, most of high-end
			digital cameras for TEM have TEM shutter control support. </p><p>The shutter discussed here is not any kind of mechanical shutter.
			Instead, it is electronic. If an alignment coil in TEM column is put to a "bad"
			value, then the beam disppears due to misalignment. We call it shutter closed.
			And we call it open when the good alignment coil current is restored. Therefore,
			this kind of electronic shutter can open and close very quickly.</p><p>An exposure on film requires no beam before film is pushed in to final
			location and stablized; and it opens shutter to let beam shine on film to
			expose and then shutter is closed again when exposure finishes. On FEI
			microscope with Low Dose funtionality, one can even define pre-expose time. In
			this case, two shuttes are required to work together - first shutter above
			specimen opens to have beam pre-expose on sample for certain period of time,
			then second shutter below specimen opens to start exposure on film. Usually, the two
			alignment coils to be controlled as upper and lower shutters are Gun Upper coil
			and a Film Shutter Coil next to projector lens. All this is done within FEI
			software control for when and which shutter is open or close. We usually call this
			internal shutter control.</p><p>To image with a digital camera, especially for a beam sensitive
			specimen, shutter control is therefore also needed. If configured correctly,
			when camera is inserted and large screen of TEM is lifted, the beam should be
			blanked. This shutter control is achieved by changing the same alignment coils
			using shutter cable(s) from camera controller. The shutter cable directly
			connects to TEM hardware so that when large screen is lifted, an extra voltage
			is sent to TEM coil to "screw up" a good alignment. Thus, beam is blanked. If
			we need to pre-expose our sample for whatever reason, then two cables will be
			needed - one for pre-specimen and one for post-specimen. This control is done
			by using external hardware. We normally call this "external" shutter control as
			it is not via TEM software. </p><p>For convenience, we usually call the shutter of Gun Upper Coil
            "the beam blanker"; and Film Shutter Coil "the film shutter".  </p></div><div class="navfooter"><hr /><table width="100%" summary="Navigation footer"><tr><td width="40%" align="left"><a accesskey="p" href="index.html">Prev</a> </td><td width="20%" align="center"> </td><td width="40%" align="right"> <a accesskey="n" href="ar01s03.html">Next</a></td></tr><tr><td width="40%" align="left" valign="top">CCD Cameras on CM120 </td><td width="20%" align="center"><a accesskey="h" href="index.html">Home</a></td><td width="40%" align="right" valign="top"> 3. Shutter Control Setup for Orius 831 and TemCam
