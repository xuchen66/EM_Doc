        224HD</h2></div></div></div><p>The Orius controller for 35mm port sided-mount camera has no shutter
        cable from the controller. Therefore, it doesn't control the beam at
        all. It is possible to add the shutter control cable to the system, but
        for acquisition of an image, the TEM shutter control is optional for
        this camera. Of course, as you might imagine, this is not ideal for
        cryoEM application.  </p><p>The picuture below is the front and back to Orius camera
        controller, and Tietz camera controller as well(small one on the
        top).  You can see there is no cable hooked on Orius controller
        for shutter control.</p><div class="figure"><a id="orius-controller"></a><div class="figure-title">Figure 2. Front and Back of controllers of Orius and TemCam 224-HD</div><div class="figure-contents"><div class="mediaobject"><img src="front-back-orius-controller.png" alt="Front and Back of controllers of Orius and TemCam 224-HD" /></div></div></div><br class="figure-break" /><p>For TemCam 224HD camera, there are shutter control cables
         from the controller box, shown in the image above. This is
         little box on the top of Orius controller. As explained in
         previous section, the two shutter control cables (in red)are
         directly connected to TEM hardware. And there is a flat
         ribbon-like cable, is also connected to TEM hardware. That is to
         control signal with large screen of TEM being Up or Down. To be
         more specific, when large screen is lifted Up, the signal from
         this "Screen" cable to controller box triggers a 5V signal
         being sent to scope via the two shutter control cables, so beam
         is blanked with large screen position as a switch.</p><p>The two cables with red connectors are labeled "BB" and "SH",
         for Beam Blanker and Shutter respectively. BB cable is connected
         to Gun Upper Coil as explained in previous section. It can be
         confirmed from scope "CURRENT READOUT " page. Below is two
         screen snapshots for large screen being at Down and Up. You can
         see the Gun Upper Coil current values in these two situations.
         One can easily see the Gun U-X is changed from -77 to -195 when
         screen is lifted.  </p><div class="figure"><a id="gun-coil-change"></a><div class="figure-title">Figure 3. Gun Coil Current Changes When Large Screen Up (left) and Down (right)</div><div class="figure-contents"><div class="mediaobject"><img src="current-scr-up-down.png" alt="Gun Coil Current Changes When Large Screen Up (left) and Down (right)" /></div></div></div><br class="figure-break" /><p>When you lift the screen, you can see beam disappearing suddenly. </p><div xmlns="" class="note"><h3 class="admontitle">Note: </h3><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The dip switch on Tietz camera control box has to flip
