			of digital camera. The purpose, in most cases, is to have no beam on camera
			except exposure period. Not all camera reaquires having TEM shutter control to
			get an image. For cryoEM applications where accurate dose is to be concerned,
			it makes a lot of sense to have shutter control. Fortunitely, most of high-end
			digital cameras for TEM have TEM shutter control support. </p><p>The shutter discussed here is not any kind of mechanical shutter.
			Instead, it is electronic. If an alignment coil in TEM column is put to a "bad"
			value, then the beam disppears due to misalignment. We call it shutter closed.
			And we call it open when the good alignment coil current is restored. Therefore,
			this kind of electronic shutter can open and close very quickly.</p><p>An exposure on film requires no beam before film is pushed in to final
			location and stablized; and it opens shutter to let beam shine on film to
			expose and then shutter is closed again when exposure finishes. On FEI
			microscope with Low Dose funtionality, one can even define pre-expose time. In
			this case, two shuttes are required to work together - first shutter above
			specimen opens to have beam pre-expose on sample for certain period of time,
			then second shutter below specimen opens to start exposure on film. Usually, the two
			alignment coils to be controlled as upper and lower shutters are Gun Upper coil
			and a Film Shutter Coil next to projector lens. All this is done within FEI
			software control for when and which shutter is open or close. We usually call this
			internal shutter control.</p><p>To image with a digital camera, especially for a beam sensitive
			specimen, shutter control is therefore also needed. If configured correctly,
			when camera is inserted and large screen of TEM is lifted, the beam should be
			blanked. This shutter control is achieved by changing the same alignment coils
			using shutter cable(s) from camera controller. The shutter cable directly
			connects to TEM hardware so that when large screen is lifted, an extra voltage
			is sent to TEM coil to "screw up" a good alignment. Thus, beam is blanked. If
			we need to pre-expose our sample for whatever reason, then two cables will be
			needed - one for pre-specimen and one for post-specimen. This control is done
			by using external hardware. We normally call this "external" shutter control as
			it is not via TEM software. </p><p>For convenience, we usually call the shutter of Gun Upper Coil
            "the beam blanker"; and Film Shutter Coil "the film shutter".  </p></div><div class="sect1"><div xmlns="" class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="title" style="clear: both"><a id="idp61825872"></a>3. Shutter Control Setup for Orius 831 and TemCam 
        224HD</h2></div></div></div><p>The Orius controller for 35mm port sided-mount camera has no shutter
        cable from the controller. Therefore, it doesn't control the beam at
        all. It is possible to add the shutter control cable to the system, but
        for acquisition of an image, the TEM shutter control is optional for
        this camera. Of course, as you might imagine, this is not ideal for
        cryoEM application.  </p><p>The picuture below is the front and back to Orius camera
        controller, and Tietz camera controller as well(small one on the
        top).  You can see there is no cable hooked on Orius controller
        for shutter control.</p><div class="figure"><a id="orius-controller"></a><div class="figure-title">Figure 2. Front and Back of controller of Orius and shutterbox of TemCam 224-HD</div><div class="figure-contents"><div class="mediaobject"><img src="front-back-orius-controller.png" alt="Front and Back of controller of Orius and shutterbox of TemCam 224-HD" /></div></div></div><br class="figure-break" /><p>For TemCam 224HD camera, there are shutter control cables
         from the controller box, shown in the image above. This is
         little box on the top of Orius controller. As explained in
         previous section, the two shutter control cables (in red)are
         directly connected to TEM hardware. And there is a flat
         ribbon-like cable, is also connected to TEM hardware. That is to
         control signal with large screen of TEM being Up or Down. To be
         more specific, when large screen is lifted Up, the signal from
         this "Screen" cable to controller box triggers a 5V signal
         being sent to scope via the two shutter control cables, so beam
         is blanked with large screen position as a switch.</p><p>The two cables with red connectors are labeled "BB" and "SH",
         for Beam Blanker and Shutter respectively. BB cable is connected
         to Gun Upper Coil as explained in previous section. It can be
         confirmed from scope "CURRENT READOUT " page. Below is two
         screen snapshots for large screen being at Down and Up. You can
         see the Gun Upper Coil current values in these two situations.
         One can easily see the Gun U-X is changed from -77 to -195 when
         screen is lifted.  </p><div class="figure"><a id="gun-coil-change"></a><div class="figure-title">Figure 3. Gun Coil Current Changes When Large Screen Up (left) and Down (right)</div><div class="figure-contents"><div class="mediaobject"><img src="current-scr-up-down.png" alt="Gun Coil Current Changes When Large Screen Up (left) and Down (right)" /></div></div></div><br class="figure-break" /><p>When you lift the screen, you can see beam disappearing suddenly. </p><div xmlns="" class="note"><h3 class="admontitle">Note: </h3><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The dip switch on Tietz camera control box has to flip

More strictly
          speaking, the disspated heat from electronic cooling has to be
          taken away by water. Therfore, we must to have cooling water
          running normally to run the CCD cameras. The set working
          temperature for Orius is 10°C, and it is -25°C for
          Tietz TemCam 224HD. The advantage to have lower temerature for
          CCD imaging is low thermal noise. In genera, it is advisable
          to let CCD be cooled long enough before using the camera.
      </p><p>The temperature can be checked for each camera using their
          softwares. For Orius, from DigitalMicorgraph, one can check
          menu Camera - Temperature. On Tietz camera, one has to start
          up TCL interface and also EMMENU from TCL. After that, one has
          to open result log window and command window. From command
          window, type "ccdpshow" and then hit
          <span class="guibutton">[ Execute ]</span>. The temperature
          will show in result window. </p><div class="figure"><a id="ccdpshow"></a><div class="figure-title">Figure 4. command "ccdpshow" to get temperature for 224HD</div><div class="figure-contents"><div class="mediaobject"><img src="ccdpshow.png" alt="command &quot;ccdpshow&quot; to get temperature for 224HD" /></div></div></div><br class="figure-break" /></div><div class="sect1"><div xmlns="" class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="title" style="clear: both"><a id="idp61862608"></a>5. Control both cameras using SerialEM</h2></div></div></div><p>Each camera has its own controlling software. It is
           DigitaMicrograph (<acronym class="acronym">DM</acronym>) for Orius and
           EM-MENU for Tietz. In order to have pixel size information,
           both software tries to communicate with CM120 via a single
           COM port. If you run start both softwares, one of them will
           complain for not being able to connect to COM port. You can
           still take images using either one, just you might not get
           scale bar for one camera. </p><p>For image data that will be processed later, the scale bar
           is not that important, but the pixelsize is. And we don't
           have to always use its own native software to control CCD
           camera to get an image. One of the good alternative is
           <span class="application"><a class="link" href="http://bio3d.colorado.edu/SerialEM/" target="_top">SerialEM</a></span>.</p><p>SerialEM is a program for TEM data collection for both
           single particle and tomography applications. It communicates
           to TEM and digital camera. Currently, it doesn't support
           CM120 without any hacking due to TEM software, but it
           controls both cameras we have just fine. One of the
           advantages with SerialEM is to be able to directy save data
           as stack file and MRC as file format. </p><p>SerialEM controls Gatan camera by a plugin dll file put in
           Gatan's plugin folder. In this case, <acronym class="acronym">DM</acronym>
           has to started. When controlling Tietz camera, it directly
           talks to the Tietz's registered dll modules. In this case, no
           Tietz software needs to be started. Therefore, one starts
           <acronym class="acronym">DM</acronym> first and then start
           <span class="application">SerialEM</span> and you are ready to go!
       </p><p>Since <span class="application">SerialEM</span> doesn't talk to
           CM120 computer, we have to use fake mag and screen position
           to match the real situation on scope. This way, the image
           file saved on SerialEM will have valid and correctly
           pixelsize information in MRC header.</p><div class="figure"><a id="fake-mag-screen"></a><div class="figure-title">Figure 5. Camera Setup Window where one can change mag and screen position to match scope </div><div class="figure-contents"><div class="mediaobject"><img src="fake-mag-screen-setup.png" alt="Camera Setup Window where one can change mag and screen position to match scope" /></div></div></div><br class="figure-break" /><p>To use it, you click on the three macro buttons
