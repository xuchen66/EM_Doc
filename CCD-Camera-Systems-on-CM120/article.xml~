   <abstract>
		<para>We no longer use film for TEM exposure anymore! Instead, we use digital
			camera. There are basically two types of digital cameras available on the
			market for TEM applications - Charge-Coupled Device (<acronym>CCD</acronym>)
			and Direct Electron Detector. On CM120, there are two cameras installed - Gatan
			Orius model 832 and Tietz TemCam 224-HD. They both are <acronym>CCD</acronym>
			type of cameras. In this document, I give information about basic properties of
			the cameras, how to use them with CM120 and specific technical note for why we
			need use them in such way.  </para>

		<para>It also lists pixelsize inforamtion for both cameras so you can decide
			which magnification you want to use for your final image. I also try to show
			you how to use <application>SerialEM</application> to control them.</para>

  <sect1> <title xml:id="shutter-control-info">Shutter Control - Background Inforamtion</title> 

		<para>Shutter control usually means TEM shutter control by hardware or software
			of digital camera. The purpose, in most cases, is to have no beam on camera
			except exposure period. Not all camera reaquires having TEM shutter control to
			get an image. For cryoEM applications where accurate dose is to be concerned,
			it makes a lot of sense to have shutter control. Fortunitely, most of high-end
			digital cameras for TEM have TEM shutter control support. </para>

		<para>The shutter discussed here is not any kind of mechanical shutter.
			Instead, it is electronic. If an alignment coil in TEM column is put to a "bad"
			value, then the beam disppears due to misalignment. We call it shutter closed.
			And we call it open when the good alignment coil current is restored. Therefore,
			this kind of electronic shutter can open and close very quickly.</para>

		<para>An exposure on film requires no beam before film is pushed in to final
			location and stablized; and it opens shutter to let beam shine on film to
			expose and then shutter is closed again when exposure finishes. On FEI
			microscope with Low Dose funtionality, one can even define pre-expose time. In
			this case, two shuttes are required to work together - first shutter above
			specimen opens to have beam pre-expose on sample for certain period of time,
			then second shutter below specimen opens to start exposure on film. Usually, the two
			alignment coils to be controlled as upper and lower shutters are Gun Upper coil
			and a Film Shutter Coil next to projector lens. All this is done within FEI
			software control for when and which shutter is open or close. We usually call this
			internal shutter control.</para>

		<para>To image with a digital camera, especially for a beam sensitive
			specimen, shutter control is therefore also needed. If configured correctly,
			when camera is inserted and large screen of TEM is lifted, the beam should be
			blanked. This shutter control is achieved by changing the same alignment coils
			using shutter cable(s) from camera controller. The shutter cable directly
			connects to TEM hardware so that when large screen is lifted, an extra voltage
			is sent to TEM coil to "screw up" a good alignment. Thus, beam is blanked. If
			we need to pre-expose our sample for whatever reason, then two cables will be
			needed - one for pre-specimen and one for post-specimen. This control is done
			by using external hardware. We normally call this "external" shutter control as
			it is not via TEM software. </para>

        <para>For convenience, we usually call the shutter of Gun Upper Coil
            "the beam blanker"; and Film Shutter Coil "the film shutter".  </para>

	<title xml:id="shutter-control-setup">Shutter Control Setup for Orius 831 and TemCam 
        224HD</title>

    <para>The Orius controller for 35mm port sided-mount camera has no shutter
        cable from the controller. Therefore, it doesn't control the beam at
        all. It is possible to add the shutter control cable to the system, but
        for acquisition of an image, the TEM shutter control is optional for
        this camera. Of course, as you might imagine, this is not ideal for
        cryoEM application.  </para>

    <para>The picuture below is the front and back to Orius camera
        controller, and Tietz camera controller as well(small one on the
        top).  You can see there is no cable hooked on Orius controller
        for shutter control.</para> 

            <figure xml:id="orius-controller">
			    <title>Front and Back of controllers of Orius and TemCam 224-HD</title>

                    </mediaobject>
			</figure>

     <para>For TemCam 224HD camera, there are shutter control cables
         from the controller box, shown in the image above. This is
         little box on the top of Orius controller. As explained in
         previous section, the two shutter control cables (in red)are
         directly connected to TEM hardware. And there is a flat
         ribbon-like cable, is also connected to TEM hardware. That is to
         control signal with large screen of TEM being Up or Down. To be
         more specific, when large screen is lifted Up, the signal from
         this "Screen" cable to controller box triggers a 5V signal
         being sent to scope via the two shutter control cables, so beam
         is blanked with large screen position as a switch.</para> 

     <para>The two cables with red connectors are labeled "BB" and "SH",
         for Beam Blanker and Shutter respectively. BB cable is connected
         to Gun Upper Coil as explained in previous section. It can be
         confirmed from scope "CURRENT READOUT " page. Below is two
         screen snapshots for large screen being at Down and Up. You can
         see the Gun Upper Coil current values in these two situations.
         One can easily see the Gun U-X is changed from -77 to -195 when
         screen is lifted.  </para>

      <note>
          <para>The dip switch on Tietz camera control box has to flip
              to right "CCD". If it is on "TEM", the shutter control by
              Tietz CCD is completely off. </para>

      <title xml:id="temperature">A Note about the Temperature</title>

      <para>These both CCD cameras are water cooled. More strictly
          speaking, the disspated heat from electronic cooling has to be
          taken away by water. Therfore, we must to have cooling water
          running normally to run the CCD cameras. The set working
          temperature for Orius is 10&deg;C, and it is -25&deg;C for
          Tietz TemCam 224HD. The advantage to have lower temerature for
          CCD imaging is low thermal noise. In genera, it is advisable
          to let CCD be cooled long enough before using the camera.
      </para>

      <para>The temperature can be checked for each camera using their
          softwares. For Orius, from DigitalMicorgraph, one can check
          menu Camera - Temperature. On Tietz camera, one has to start
          up TCL interface and also EMMENU from TCL. After that, one has
          to open result log window and command window. From command
          window, type "ccdpshow" and then hit
          <guibutton>[&nbsp;Execute&nbsp;]</guibutton>. The temperature
          will show in result window. </para>

   </sect1> 

   <sect1> <title xml:id="serialem">Control both cameras using SerialEM</title>

       <para>Each camera has its own controlling software. It is
           DigitaMicrograph (<acronym>DM</acronym>) for Orius and
           EM-MENU for Tietz. In order to have pixel size information,
           both software tries to communicate with CM120 via a single
           COM port. If you run start both softwares, one of them will
           complain for not being able to connect to COM port. You can
           still take images using either one, just you might not get
           scale bar for one camera. </para>

       <para>For image data that will be processed later, the scale bar
           is not that important, but the pixelsize is. And we don't
           have to always use its own native software to control CCD
           camera to get an image. One of the good alternative is
           <application><link
                   xlink:href="http://bio3d.colorado.edu/SerialEM/">SerialEM</link></application>.</para>

       <para>SerialEM is a program for TEM data collection for both
           single particle and tomography applications. It communicates
           to TEM and digital camera. Currently, it doesn't support
           CM120 without any hacking due to TEM software, but it
           controls both cameras we have just fine. One of the
           advantages with SerialEM is to be able to directy save data
           as stack file and MRC as file format. </para>

       <para>SerialEM controls Gatan camera by a plugin dll file put in
           Gatan's plugin folder. In this case, <acronym>DM</acronym>
           has to started. When controlling Tietz camera, it directly
           talks to the Tietz's registered dll modules. In this case, no
           Tietz software needs to be started. Therefore, one starts
           <acronym>DM</acronym> first and then start
           <application>SerialEM</application> and you are ready to go!
       </para>

   <sect1> <title xml:id="pixelsize">Pixlesize Calibration for Both Cameras</title>
      
       <para>The tabe below list pixelsize at specimen level for
           different scope magnificatios. Please note that with large
           screen position as Up and Down, the CM120 TEM interface
           display different mag values. This is meant for mag at
           different "collecting" level - ScreenDown mag means at screen
           level and ScreenUp means at film level. We run Orius with
           screen Down and Tietz with Screen Up.</para>
