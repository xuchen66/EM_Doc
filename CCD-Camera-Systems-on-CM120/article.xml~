   <abstract>

        <para>We no longer use film for TEM exposure anymore! Instead,
            we use digital camera. There are basically two types of
            digital cameras available on the market for TEM applications
            - Charge-Coupled Device (<acronym>CCD</acronym>) and Direct
            Electron Detector. On CM120, there are two cameras installed
            - Gatan Orius model 832 and Tietz TemCam 224-HD. They both
            are <acronym>CCD</acronym> type of cameras. In this
            document, I give information about basic properties of the
            cameras, how to use them with CM120 and specific technical
            note for why we need use them in such way.  </para>

        <para>It also lists pixelsize information for both cameras so
            you can decide which magnification you want to use for your
            final image. I also try to show you how to use
            <application>SerialEM</application> to control them.</para>

  <sect1> <title xml:id="shutter-control-info">Shutter Control - Background Inforamtion</title> 

        <para>Shutter control usually means TEM shutter control by
            hardware or software of digital camera. The purpose, in most
            cases, is to have no beam on camera except exposure period.
            Not all camera requires having TEM shutter control to get an
            image. For cryoEM applications where accurate dose is to be
            concerned, it makes a lot of sense to have shutter control.
            Fortunately, most of high-end digital cameras for TEM have
            TEM shutter control support. </para>

        <para>The shutter discussed here is not any kind of mechanical
            shutter.  Instead, it is electronic. If an alignment coil in
            TEM column is put to a "bad" value, then the beam disappears
            due to misalignment. We call it shutter closed.  And we call
            it open when the good alignment coil current is restored.
            Therefore, this kind of electronic shutter can open and
            close very quickly.</para>

        <para>An exposure on film requires no beam before film is pushed
            in to final location and stabilized; and it opens shutter to
            let beam shine on film to expose and then shutter is closed
            again when exposure finishes. On FEI microscope with Low
            Dose functionality, one can even define pre-expose time. In
            this case, two shutters are required to work together -
            first shutter above specimen opens to have beam pre-expose
            on sample for certain period of time, then second shutter
            below specimen opens to start exposure on film. Usually, the
            two alignment coils to be controlled as upper and lower
            shutters are Gun Upper coil and a Film Shutter Coil next to
            projector lens. All this is done within FEI software control
            for when and which shutter is open or close. We usually call
            this internal shutter control.</para>

        <para>To image with a digital camera, especially for a beam
            sensitive specimen, shutter control is therefore also
            needed. If configured correctly, when camera is inserted and
            large screen of TEM is lifted, the beam should be blanked.
            This shutter control is achieved by changing the same
            alignment coils using shutter cable(s) from camera
            controller. The shutter cable directly connects to TEM
            hardware so that when large screen is lifted, an extra
            voltage is sent to TEM coil to "screw up" a good alignment.
            Thus, beam is blanked. If we need to pre-expose our sample
            for whatever reason, then two cables will be needed - one
            for pre-specimen and one for post-specimen. This control is
            done by using external hardware. We normally call this
            "external" shutter control as it is not via TEM software.
        </para>

        <para>For convenience, we usually call the shutter of Gun Upper
            Coil "the beam blanker"; and Film Shutter Coil "the film
            shutter".  </para>

	<title xml:id="shutter-control-setup">Shutter Control Setup for Orius 831 and TemCam 
        224HD</title>

    <para>The Orius controller for 35mm port sided-mount camera has no
        shutter cable from the controller. Therefore, it doesn't control
        the beam at all. It is possible to add the shutter control cable
        to the system, but for acquisition of an image, the TEM shutter
        control is optional for this camera. Of course, as you might
        imagine, this is not ideal for cryoEM application.  </para>

    <para>The picture below is the front and back to Orius camera
        controller, and Tietz camera shutterbox as well(small one on the
        top).  You can see there is no cable hooked on Orius controller
        for shutter control.</para> 

            <figure xml:id="orius-controller">

                    </mediaobject>
			</figure>

     <para>For TemCam 224HD camera, there are shutter control cables
         from the controller box, shown in the image above. This is
         little box on the top of Orius controller. As explained in
         previous section, the two shutter control cables (in red)are
         directly connected to TEM hardware. And there is a flat
         ribbon-like cable, is also connected to TEM hardware. That is
         to control signal with large screen of TEM being Up or Down. To
         be more specific, when large screen is lifted Up, the signal
         from this "Screen" cable to controller box triggers a 5V signal
         being sent to scope via the two shutter control cables, so beam
         is blanked with large screen position as a switch.</para> 

     <para>The two cables with red connectors are labeled "BB" and "SH",
         for Beam Blanker and Shutter respectively. BB cable is
         connected to Gun Upper Coil as explained in previous section.
         It can be confirmed from scope "CURRENT READOUT " page. Below
         is two screen snapshots for large screen being at Down and Up.
         You can see the Gun Upper Coil current values in these two
         situations.  One can easily see the Gun U-X is changed from -77
         to -195 when screen is lifted.  </para>

      <para>When you lift the screen, you should also see beam
          disappearing suddenly. </para>

      <note>
          <para>SH shutter is hooked to the film shutter coil, which is
              not among the coil currents displayed here. It is indeed
              working. One can confirm this by disconnecting BB cable -
              the beam still disappears when large screen is UP.
              According to the vendor, this shutterbox can not provide
              pre-expsure function. One will have to upggrade to
              shutterbox II for that. </para>

              to right "CCD". If it is on "TEM", the shutter control by

      <title xml:id="temperature">A Note about the Temperature</title>

      <para>These both CCD cameras are water cooled. More strictly
          speaking, the dissipated heat from electronic cooling has to
          be taken away by water. Therefore, we must to have cooling
          water running normally to run the CCD cameras. The set working
          temperature for Orius is 10&deg;C, and it is -25&deg;C for
          Tietz TemCam 224HD. The advantage to have lower temperature
          for CCD imaging is low thermal noise. In general, it is
          advisable to let CCD be cooled long enough before using the
          camera. In most labs, the CCD camera is simply left ON all the
          time until camera chamber is vented.  </para>

      <para>The temperature can be checked for each camera using their
          softwares. For Orius, from DigitalMicorgraph, one can check
          menu Camera - Temperature. On Tietz camera, one has to start
          up TCL interface and also EMMENU from TCL. After that, one has
          to open result log window and command window. From command
          window, type "ccdpshow" and then hit
          <guibutton>[&nbsp;Execute&nbsp;]</guibutton>. The temperature
          will show in result window. </para>

   <sect1> <title xml:id="serialem">Control both cameras using SerialEM</title>

       <para>Each camera has its own controlling software. It is
           DigitaMicrograph (<acronym>DM</acronym>) for Orius and
           EM-MENU for Tietz. In order to have pixel size information,
           both software tries to communicate with CM120 via a single
           COM port. If you run start both softwares, one of them will
           complain for not being able to connect to COM port. You can
           still take images using either one, just you might not get
           scale bar for one camera. </para>

       <para>For image data that will be processed later, the scale bar
           is not that important, but the pixelsize is. And we don't
           have to always use its own native software to control CCD
           camera to get an image. One of the good alternative is
           <application><link
                   xlink:href="http://bio3d.colorado.edu/SerialEM/">SerialEM</link></application>.</para>

       <para>SerialEM is a program for TEM data collection for both
           single particle and tomography applications. It communicates
           to TEM and digital camera. Currently, it doesn't support
           CM120 without any hacking due to TEM software, but it
           controls both cameras we have just fine. One of the
           advantages with SerialEM is to be able to directly save data
           as stack file and MRC as image format. </para>

       <para>SerialEM controls Gatan camera by a plugin dll file put in
           Gatan's plugin folder. In this case, <acronym>DM</acronym>
           has to started. When controlling Tietz camera, it directly
           talks to the Tietz's registered dll modules. In this case, no
           Tietz software needs to be started. Therefore, one starts
           <acronym>DM</acronym> first and then start
           <application>SerialEM</application> and you are ready to go!
       </para>

       <para>Since <application>SerialEM</application> doesn't talk to
           CM120 computer, we have to use fake mag and screen position
           to match the real situation on scope. This way, the image
           file saved on SerialEM will have valid and correctly
           pixelsize information in MRC header.</para>

       <title xml:id="dose">Electron Dose</title>

       <para>A proper dose on sample for an exposure is important. If
           the total dose is too low, the signal to noise ratio is low.
           If the total dose is too high, the sample gets radiation
           damage during exposure. With the latest CMOS direct electron
           detector, we might be able to record a single exposure into
           many separable frames, but the idea for dose and radiation
           damage still holds.</para>

       <para>On a real system, if we know the value how many counts
           generated from one primary electron under a specif
           accelarating voltage, and we can calculate the total dose
           (e/A^2) from the mean value of the counts in an image.
       </para>

       <para>SerialEM is setup so that it reports the dose on speciment
           on the top of the image display.</para>
   </sect1>

   <sect1> <title xml:id="pixelsize">Pixlesize Calibration for Both Cameras</title>
      
       <para>The table below list pixelsize at specimen level for
           different scope magnifications. Please note that with large
           screen position as Up and Down, the CM120 TEM interface
           display different mag values. There is no difference in term
           of lens current in this case - this is due to the recording
           media being at different "collecting" level along the
           projection. ScreenDown mag means at screen level and ScreenUp
           means at film level. We run Orius with screen Down and Tietz
           with Screen Up.</para>

       <para>The magnifications display in TEM interface are nominal.
           For actual magnification or pixelsize at specimen for a CCD
           camera, careful calibration is needed. Below is the
           calibration table for both cameras.</para>
